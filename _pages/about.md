Hello! I am Rodrigo Grijalba. For the past several years I have worked in Data Scicence and Software Development. I specialize on Causal Inference, Economics, Artificial Intelligence-integrated systems, and their intersections. Outside of the Industry and Academia, my main interests lie in specialty coffee and music.

Overview
======
My past and present work include AI Systems like [Illa](https://elcomercio.pe/ecdata/violencia-obstetrica-ginecologica-que-es-victima-atencion-medica-realidad-normalizada-afecta-mujeres-partos-peru-oms-salud-reproductiva-derecho-sexual-chatbot-illa-especdis-noticia/), an AI ChatBot built specifically to inform and guide victims of obstetric-gynecological violence. I have also created several packages for Causal Inference analysis using R, Python, and Julia. A few examples include [HDML.jl](https://github.com/d2cml-ai/HDMjl.jl) for high-dimensional metrics of causal effects, and [syntdid.py](https://github.com/d2cml-ai/synthdid.py) for Synthetic Difference-in-Differences causal effect estimation. As for my research work, one notable example is [Impact of the Availability of Chat-GPT on Software Development](https://github.com/RodrigoGrijalba/RodrigoGrijalba.github.io/blob/master/files/gpt_github_sdid.pdf), together with [Alexander Quispe](https://alexanderquispe.github.io/), initially presented at the MÃ¼nich Summer Institute 2024 event.
